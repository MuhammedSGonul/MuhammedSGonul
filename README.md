# Hi, I'm Muhammed ğŸ‘‹

I am currently a computer engineering student, and I spend the majority of my time developing games and dedicating a portion to artificial intelligence-machine learning. However, as some of my content may suggest, I have previously been involved in electronic and robotics projects, and I continue to pursue these interests as hobbies ğŸš€ğŸš€
